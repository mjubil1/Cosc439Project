To run this code, you are going to have to download Andriod Studio first in your laptop or desktop.
After installing Andriod Studio you have to install Andriod System Image that the emulators can use.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need an emulator to see how the app works. Follow the following steps to install the system:

1. Start the Android SDK Manager (select Start | All Programs | Embarcadero RAD Studio | Android Tools).
2. In the packages tree, locate and check the ARM EABI v7a System Image node within the first Android node in the list.
    For example: Android 4.2.2 (API 17) or Android 4.3 (API 18)
3. Click Install 1 package. (Clear any checkboxes that were auto-selected.)
4. In the Choose Packages to Install page, click Accept License, and then click Install to install the system image.

Now creating an emulator:
To create an Android emulator on your system, follow these steps:

1. Start the Android SDK Manager (select Start | All Programs | Embarcadero RAD Studio | Android Tools).
2. In the Android SDK Manager, select Tools | Manage AVDs.
3. In the Android Virtual Device Manager, click the New button to create a new virtual device.
4. In the Create new Android Virtual Device (AVD) dialog box, select an Android device to emulate, and enter the details          describing the Android device you want to emulate. In order to run a FireMonkey mobile application, your Android emulator      must meet the following requirements:
     - In Target, select an Android SDK with an API level that is 17 or higher. The drop-down list contains your installed            versions of the Android SDK.
     - Under Emulation Options, check Use Host GPU.
     - In Device, select the Android device to emulate.
       Tip: Emulating an older Android device like the Nexus S might be faster than emulating a newer, larger device like the         Nexus 10.
5. Click OK twice to create your new Android emulator.
6. You can now view your emulator in the Android Virtual Device Manager.
